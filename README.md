# Multilingual Spam Detection with BERT

A powerful spam detection system that combines BERT classification with multilingual support. The system can detect spam across multiple languages by first translating the input text to English and then applying a highly accurate BERT-based classifier trained on spam/ham emails and SMS messages.

## 🎯 Features

- 99% accurate BERT-based spam classification
- Multi-language support (English, French, Spanish, Arabic)
- Real-time translation to English before classification
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Pre-trained translation models using Opus-MT

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/benali-ayoub/Spam-Detection-SMS-Email.git
cd spam-detection
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Start the Streamlit dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Enter your text in any supported language (English, French, Spanish, or Arabic)

4. The system will:
   - Detect the input language
   - Translate the text to English if necessary
   - Classify the text as spam or ham
   - Display the results with confidence scores

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### BERT Classifier
- Based on BERT base model
- Fine-tuned on spam/ham dataset
